# NexPay Senior Full-Stack Developer coding test

You're asked to implement a small web application. It should take about 2 hours to complete. Despite being a small application, please make sure that you demonstrate an approach that is suitable when developing large-scale solutions.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional

- A web form allows a user to submit standard Australian bank payment details (BSB, account number, account name, reference and the payment amount)
- On submit of the form, the user is notified about the outcome of the operation and all the payment data is saved in a text file on the server
- Entered data is validated (please use common sense to define applicable validation rules)
- The form is well-presented and is convenient to use on different screen sizes, as well as both touch- and non-touch screens

### Non-functional

- Code is written in a way that makes it easy to maintain
- Both front end and back end have appropriate unit test coverage
- Key user activities are logged, both on front end and back end
- Front end is implemented as an SPA
- Back end is written in C#
- Source code is stored in a Git repository that shows how the development progressed

_Any details not described above is up to you to decide upon._
